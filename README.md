# Life Countable

> Visualize your life in weeks. Every week matters.

A minimalist web application that visualizes your life as a grid of weeks. The average human life spans approximately **73.5 years** — that's only **3,827 weeks**. Each cell in the grid represents one week of your life: lived or yet to come.

- **Appreciate each week** as a finite, valuable unit
- **Reflect** on how you spend your time
- **Visualize** your life's progress in a tangible way

## How it works

1. **Enter your name and birth date**
2. The app calculates how many weeks you've lived
3. See your life as a grid of 3,827 cells:
   - 🟧 **Orange cells** = weeks you've already lived
   - ⬛ **Gray cells** = weeks yet to come

## Design & Technology

Built with a minimalist, lo-fi aesthetic inspired by early computing interfaces:

- **[Departure Mono](https://departuremono.com/)** — A monospaced pixel font by Helena Zhang
- **React + TypeScript + Vite** — Modern web stack
- **Pure CSS** — No UI frameworks, custom responsive design
- **LocalStorage** — Your data stays in your browser

The design is inspired by GitHub's contribution graph and the concept of "Life in Weeks" popularized by Tim Urban's Wait But Why.

## Why 3,827 weeks?

73.5 years × 52 weeks = **3,827 weeks**

This is the current global average life expectancy. Of course, everyone's journey is different — this is just a reference point to help visualize the finite nature of time.
